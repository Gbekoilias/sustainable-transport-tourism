## Introduction

The integration of sustainable transport is critical to enhancing destination management in the tourism sector. Despite its positive impacts, there are challenges related to public attitudes, particularly among students, which this research aims to explore and address.

## Research Objectives

- To determine the influence of sustainable transport integration on destination management.
- To assess the perceptions and satisfaction levels of students regarding sustainable transport options.
- To explore the relationship between sustainable transportation and destination management.
- To evaluate different sustainable transportation modes and their economic, environmental, and social implications.

## Methodology

This study employed both primary and secondary data collection methods. A quantitative approach was used, with 120 structured questionnaires distributed via social media and in person to students. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and correlation coefficients.

## Key Findings

- Students prioritize cheaper sustainable transport options due to economic factors.
- There is a significant positive relationship between sustainable transport and destination management.
- Sustainable transportation enhances tourist satisfaction and contributes to effective destination management.

## Impact on Destination Management

Sustainable transport options are essential for improving destination management in the tourism sector. They offer economic, environmental, and social benefits, which are crucial for sustainable tourism development.

## Sustainability Perspectives

The research explored three key areas:
- **Economic:** Cost-effectiveness of sustainable transport for students.
- **Environmental:** Reduction of carbon footprint through eco-friendly transportation.
- **Social:** Improved accessibility and convenience for tourists.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The findings suggest that sustainable transportation significantly impacts the tourism sector. It is recommended that governments and tourism managers integrate transportation options more closely with destination amenities and attractions to maximize the benefits.
